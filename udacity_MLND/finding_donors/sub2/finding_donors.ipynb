    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *UdacityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would is appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *UdacityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *UdacityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "- If the ML approach for identifying donors is successful, we can anticipate follow-on ML calculations to involve larger datasets. Prediction and training time ( if either is executed on a ‘paid cloud’) translated to non-trivial cost to CharityML, and should be minimized wherever feasible. \n",
    "- The dataset (45K) is reasonably sized, but not huge (e.g. deep learning sized) and not very noisy  to our knowledge (e.g in terms of missing or erroneous data). So issues of sparse data or small training sets may be less important. In fact this piece of work (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25665017/does-the-dataset-size-influence-a-machine-learning-algorithm) suggests that the learnig curve of most of the supervised learning algorithms we’ve worked with so far should flatten well within our 36K training set.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "For CharityML, we need a ML algorithm that is \n",
    "- a) highly accurate in identifying promising donors, \n",
    "- b) reasonable in compute cost for the kinds of datasets we might encounter in the future, \n",
    "- c)  good at explaining the conclusions it arrived at and \n",
    "- d)suitable to the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data itself is reasonably clean and moderate in size, with no noticeable irregularities (e.g. lots of outliers). So I'm going to focus in my recommendation on criteria a, b and c. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the detailed metrics below on Naive Bayes (NB), kNN and SVM, **I'm going to recommend SVMs** for the following reasons:\n",
    " - NB, while blazingly fast on training and prediction, is vastly inferior to both kNN and SVM on accuracy and f_score.\n",
    " - kNN and SVM are neck-and-neck in many ways. they both are pretty accurate (82-83%) and have similar f-scores (.59, .60). \n",
    " - both kNN and SVM have issues in prediction/training time. exponential increase in SVM training time with training set growth is a concern. for kNNs, exponential growth in prediction time is a concern.\n",
    " - theoretical work on SVM training time https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-computational-complexity-of-an-SVM suggests that concern is well founded, but also something where there are known techniques to improve (e.g. regularization)\n",
    " - the 5% difference in acc_train and acc_test on kNN suggests that it is overfitting, where SVM is delivering good performance without overfitting\n",
    " - since kNN's are non-generalizing, they may produce better explanations that generalizing schemes like SVM. however, keeping the SVM kernels simple should help us explain the conclusions despite generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "All told I feel that even though SVMs are 'compute hungry', they provide good accuracy without overfitting. SVMs are widely used in the industry, and so more optimizable. While SVM and kNN may look similar in performance at the larger datasets, kNN is flattening while SVM is still trending up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data is below:\n",
    "**Naive Bayes**\n",
    "Accuracy_test = .60 for 36K training set, trending up steeply\n",
    "F_test = .54 but still trending up with training size\n",
    "Prediction Time. orders of magnitude faster than kNN and SVM\n",
    "Training time. fast (0.06 seconds for 36K training set) and grew sub-linearly with training size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**kNN**\n",
    "- Accuracy_test = 0.82 but flattening out\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for both classification and regression. We'll focus here on the more common usage of SVM's that is in classification. In classification (assuming the data is in two dimensions), the idea is to find a line that separates the plane into zones that represent 'yes' (members of the class) and 'no' (not members of the class). When data has a lot of dimensions (103 in the CharityML case) the analog to that dividing line is what is called a 'hyperplane'. Another intuition for hyperplane is that in 3-dimensions the hyperplane is a 'plane' (think of a glass sheet that separates members of the class from non-members). \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](margin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important SVM concept after hyperplanes is *margin*. Back to the 2-dimensional example, data in 2-dimensions can be separated by many different lines. The *margin* is the distance between the line and the closest point(s) on either side (members zone and non-member zone). SVM chooses the line that *maximizes the margin* as the optimal dividing line (or hyperplane) for classification. Intuitively a *maximum margin hyperplane* separates the class and non-class members without *overfitting* (i.e. getting too close to one side or the other). \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](messy data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The third thing to know about SVM's is *kernels*. Many datasets don't have a clean dividing line (margin) like the first picture, and might look more like the second (mingled) picture. In this picture (right above), there is no straight line you can draw separates legitimate members of the class from non-members.\n",
    "You can think of *kernels* as adding a dimension to 'levitate' some of the points (as shown below) so that points that could only be separated by a squiggly line can now be separated by a (hyper)planes that is linear and has no squiggles in it\n",

So I did an experiment trading off the 'width' of the grid (number of C and gamma combinations I tried) with the size of the training set I tried it on. Based on 6 runs (of which 3 are captured above), my conclusion is that given the same compute power, it is better to search more broadly with a smaller data set (as long as it is above say 1K data items) than vice-versa.\n",

    "- Intuitively, i felt strongly that age should be in the top 5 but the dataset from which i drew conclusion had a number of older folk with high school education (or less) made it hard to make that case\n",
    "- I was correct in including education, but perhaps redundantly included both education_level and education-num\n",
    "- I (incorrectly?) included country, because I felt that the same occupation has much higher compensation in 'first world' countries (e.g. US) versus less developed (e.g. Cuba). This seems a strong conclusion on my initial data set\n",
    "- I saw a much stronger correlation to occupation (e.g. executive/managerial make substantially more) and am surprised that didn't manifest itself.\n",
    "- I didn't pick marital status (married) figuring it was strongly associated with age\n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

( Accuracy: 0.8527, F-score: 0.7287). Is this because the other 4 features contribute noise from being either sparse, or imperfectly functionally dependent on the 9? "
